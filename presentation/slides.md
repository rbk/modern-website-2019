### Core Architecture Goals

One of the main goals of a technology team is to be more productive. 

The more productive we are, the more time we have to make the business stronger by building great products and services.

### Our websites should be:

#### 1. Easy to host
#### 2. Easy for developers to work on
#### 3. Easy to deploy to production
#### 4. Scalable over the long term


???
- Why is this better?
- We don't want to manage servers, we want to create products.
